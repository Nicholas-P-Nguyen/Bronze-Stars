                    Princeton's unofficial motto underscores a philosophy of serving a greater purpose, a principle profoundly embodied by veterans. 
                    These individuals, from past, present, and future, embody this spirit through their experiences in the armed forces and at times pay the ultimate sacrifice for their service to the nation.

            <p>The Bronze Stars scattered across Princeton's campus serve as memorials to 
                alumni who lost their lives in wars. These stars are not only markers of sacrifice
                but also physical manisfestations of the university's motto. They seek to remind
                all members of the community, of the ultimate service
                to the nation that our alumns gave to the nation, emphasizing our responsibility to remember the fallen.

                    At Princeton University, the ethos of service is deeply embedded in our identity, guided by our unofficial motto: "In the Nationâ€™s Service and the Service of Humanity." This commitment is not only a part of our academic and cultural fabric but is also etched into the very grounds of the campus through the bronze stars.
                    These memorials remind us of the profound ties that the veterans before us established through their ultimate sacrifices, forging a legacy of honor and duty that continues to inspire generations.
                    In this light, the re-establishment of our transfer program in 2018, a program which had been dormant for nearly three decades, now serves as a vital pathway for veterans to join the Princeton community, enriching our campus with their unique insights and experiences.
