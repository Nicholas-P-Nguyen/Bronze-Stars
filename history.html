                    As Princeton University has expanded and evolved, the layout and daily traffic patterns of the campus have also changed, affecting how students and faculty interact with the bronze stars commemorating the fallen. Originally placed in areas of high foot traffic, these stars were encountered frequently by the university community. However, due to new buildings, altered walkways, and the decentralization of student activities, these stars are not as prominently encountered in the routines of many students today.</p>
