            <p>
                I joined the Marine Corps in 2016-2020 with a determination to transform my life and give back 
                to the country that took in my family during the Vietnam War. We faced numerous financial hardships
                which took me away from my studies, after barely graduating high school with a 2.4 GPA in 
                2014, I worked and struggled through a year of community college which ended with a 
                disheartening 1.0 GPA. <br>
                <br>
                My decision to join the Marine Corps marked a pivotal moment in my life as it reshaped my
                prespective , instilling in me a strong sense of discipline, curiosity, and problem-solving
                abilities. Thanks to the G.I. Bill, I saw chance to redefine my educational path. Leveraging the
                skills developed during my serice, I excelled academically, and more importantly, proving to myself
                that I could be sucessful in higher education. This success spurred me to reach even higher,
                leading me to apply to some of the nation's top universities. Today, I am proud to be a 
                student at Princeton University, doing what I can to advocate for all veterans.
